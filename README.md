# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.0 and [Angular material](https://material.angular.io/) version 15.1.2.

# Backend

For this project simulation scope code, the backend server was set at [typicode](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/nakaohideki/backend-Angular/products), an online backend server designed only for simulations purposes. (changes that would be made by put, patch, and delete HTTP methods requests are not kept in the database).

# Application deploy

This application deployment was done by integrating an open-source database into it. The recovery and storage data process is made through HTTP methods and the authentication process with data contained at the HTTP request headers.

The code with these data was not imported to Git to keep the database access information confidential.
