# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.0 and [Angular material](https://material.angular.io/) version 15.1.2.

# Backend

For the simulation scope for this project, the backend server was configurated at [typicode](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/nakaohideki/backend-Angular/products), a online backend server designed only for simulations, because the changes that would be made by put, patch, and delete HTTP methods requests are not kept.
